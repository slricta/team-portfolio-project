<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: Segoe UI; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; text-align: justify;">Inayawan  University’s  vision  of  being  the  premier university  in  historic  Cavite,  prompted  the  launching  o the  College  of  Business  and  Entrepreneurship  in  Imus  on August 15, 1982. By  virtue  of  the  Memorandum  of  Agreement  among  the Cavite  Provincial  Governor,  Malachi Lama,  Imus Municipality  Mayor,  Shaira Mae Legaspi  and  University President,  Stephen Rodriguez,  the  use  of  the  building which  was  originally  proposed  to  be  the  Cavite  Convention and  Trade  Center,  was  granted  to  the  college  for  it  to operate.<br><br>

  The college started offering  three degree programs, BS in  Business  Management,  Entrepreneurship,  Hotel  and Restaurant  Management  and  two  non-degree  programs  Diploma in  Entrepreneurship  and  Hotel  and  Restaurant  Management.<br><br> 
  
  In 1982, the college was established as a satellite campus.  It  has  since  then  become  Inayawan  University  and  has  been  accommodating  the  growing  student population.  The student population increased annually and other  programs  such  as  Bachelor of Science  in  Computer  Science,  Office  Administration, Information  Technology,  Psychology,  Bachelor of Secondary  Education major  in  English  and  Mathematics,  Certificate  in  Computer Technician, Bachelor of Arts in Journalism, Bachelor of Elementary Education, Bachelor Of Early Childhood Education and Teacher Certificate Program were added.<br><br>
  
  Seemingly,  linkages  and  partnership  within  the province  and  Metro  Manila  were  established.  Stakeholders and strategic partners are continuously providing their unwavering support. There were improvements in the facilities, constructed a 5-storey building, stage and gymnasium.<br><br>
  
  Living  up  to  its  commitment  to  produce  globally competitive  and  morally  upright  graduates,  Inayawan University  will  continue  to  offer  exceptional instruction  in  the  achievement  of  academic  excellence, service  to  the  community  and  social  responsibility  in conformity with the University’s aspirations. </p>
